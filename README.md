## Introduction. 
Over 7 billion people live on the planet earth with about 2 billion of them from Africa. Food production and consumption is however a very important factor to Human survival and should be critically looked at. Being an intern of Data Storytelling at Hamoye, I have being saddled with the responsibility of performing a wholesome analysis of the Africa’s food production and consumption data provided by Hamoye. This analysis is to cut across the different Food items produced in Africa while looking at the trends in food production and consumption over the year. A comparison of the Average food production and consumption for each year will also be carried out. 
A look into the population of African Countries and how they affect Africa’s food production and consumption would also help to understand how these variables affect and contribute to Africa’s food shortage and surpluses. 
 
 
Checking for patterns in data can be pretty interesting and this repository contains codes used for this purpose. kudos to Hamoye for the brilliant challenge.

Using Python for Data wrangling and visualization, i was able to come to a conclusion and a report was written to effectively document the data analysis process
